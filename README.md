#Diving into Algorithms and Data Structures

Repository hosting varied sets of algorithms and data structures intended towards increasing overall understanding of our favourite topic in computer science.

##Curated algorithms and data structures implemented 

| Name        | Remarks  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [Trie Datastructure](./src/trie-data-structure.js)|An ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings  |
| [Multiple stacks within array](./src/stacks-stuffed-inside-array.js)|Stuffing multiple stacks inside single array and handling shrinking and expanding based over space crunch  |
| [Merge sorted arrays with folding](./src/merging-sorted-arrays.js)|Merges input sorted arrays to produce sorted array the source array with buffer is modified with result|
| [Searching in rotated sorted array](./src/searching-rotated-sorted-array.js)|Applying binary search in an sorted array but taking care of rotation by eliminating wasteful paths|
